   What do Data Scientists do?
      Collect Data
      Clean/Prepare Data
      EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
         Data Visualizations
         Data Mining (Patterns/Categories/Groups)
      Statistical Inferences
      Build/Refine Models
         Machine Learning, etc...
      Deploy/Document/Storytell

      Repeat all these steps (Iterative)

   Why use Python for Data Science?
      Easy to learn
      free ,open source 
      Support for the life cycle of software (Prototyping, development, testing, release, maintenance)
      Many available library's.
      Many supported GUI backends
      LOTS of community support/development online

   Datasets
      Structured data can be structured into rows and columns 
      
      Each row is an "instance"
         could also be called 'Example', 'record', or 'object'

      Each column is an "attribute" (of the instance)
         could also be called 'variables' or 'fields'

      A "dataset" is a (sample) set of instances
         from the 'universe of objects' (universe of instances) 


   Git/Github

      Version Control - A tool for tracking changes in files
      Git is a tool for version control
         Others exist, but git is the most popular
      Github - a website for posting git repos
         A repo (repository) is a folder under version control

      Your machine's repo is considered as 'Local'

      A commit is a named snapshot of file changes
      You can push the local commits up to the cloud
      As well as pull cloud commits to a new local repository (new machine)
      
   (The rest of class was about creating a helloworld github repo using vscode's source control)

   / is floating point division
      5 / 2 = 2.5
   // is integer division
      5 / 2 = 2
   % is mod
      5 % 2 = 1
   ** is exponent
      2 ** 5 = 32
   
   pow() also exists, it is in the math module
   to use a module you need to import it
   imports are at the top
